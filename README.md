Hi! My name is **Vincent Gerard B. Sabillena** from 9 - Campion A, a student of Ateneo de Naga University Junior High School. **Essentials by Vince** is a get-to-know-me page wherein you can have glimpses of my life through this E-Portfolio. Visit this website before you head on to Tales By Vince.

### First, the Basics and my Interests:
- I was born on March 1, 2007 in Mother Seton Hospital. Now, I am 15 years old.

## Second, My Hobbies and Strengths
1. I love writing stories and reflections.
2. I enjoy reading books and one of my favorites is The Little Prince (Le Petit Prince).

3. I am a consistent honor student, lector in the mass, and declamation/elocution/extemporaneous speech champion.

## My Dream
My dream is to become a doctor (cardiologist) to help others especially those who are less fortunate. As Ateneans, we should be Men and Women for others and act for the greater glory of God.
